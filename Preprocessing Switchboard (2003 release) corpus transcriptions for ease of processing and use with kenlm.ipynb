      "    15\tyeah it\r\n",
      "    16\tif they put state tax in i mean i'll be pretty upset\r\n",
      "    17\tbecause i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to texas from virginia was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about sixty dollars to your paycheck\r\n",
